## 1. We recommend configuring the following parameters:

- Change the value of _parPolicyManagementGroupId_ to the management group where you wish to deploy the policies, initiatives and policy assignments. This is usually the pseudo root management group.
- Change the value of _ALZMonitorResourceGroupName_ to the name of the resource group where the activity logs, resource health alerts, actions groups and alert processing rules are placed in.
- Change the value of _ALZMonitorResourceGroupTags_ to specify the tags to be added to said resource group.
- Change the value of _ALZMonitorResourceGroupLocation_ to specify the location for said resource group.
- Change the value of _ALZMonitorActionGroupEmail_ (specific to the Service Health initiative) to the email address where notifications of the alerts are sent to.

These changes have to be made in each of the following parameters files:

- [parameters-complete-connectivity.json](https://github.com/Azure/alz-monitor/infra-as-code/bicep/parameters-complete-connectivity.json)
- [parameters-complete-identity.json](https://github.com/Azure/alz-monitor/infra-as-code/bicep/parameters-complete-identity.json)
- [parameters-complete-landingzones.json](https://github.com/Azure/alz-monitor/infra-as-code/bicep/parameters-complete-landingzones.json)
- [parameters-complete-management.json](https://github.com/Azure/alz-monitor/infra-as-code/bicep/parameters-complete-management.json)
- [parameters-complete-servicehealth.json](https://github.com/Azure/alz-monitor/infra-as-code/bicep/parameters-complete-servicehealth.json)

## 2. Example Parameter file:

Note that the parameter file shown below has been truncated for brevity, compared to the samples included.

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentParameters.json#",
    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
    "parameters": {
        "parPolicyManagementGroupId": {
            "value": "Contoso"
        },
        "parPolicyAssignmentParameters": {
            "value": {
                "ALZMonitorResourceGroupName": {
                    "value": "rg-alz-monitor"
                },
                "ALZMonitorResourceGroupTags": {
                    "value": {
                        "Environment": "Production",
                        "Project": "ALZ Monitor"
                    }
                },
                "ALZMonitorResourceGroupLocation": {
                    "value": "eastus"
                }
            }
        },
        "parPolicyAssignmentParametersServiceHealth": {
            "value": {
                "ALZMonitorActionGroupEmail": {
                    "value": "action@mail.com"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
## 3. Configure and run the workflow
First, configure your OpenID Connect as described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-portal%2Cwindows#use-the-azure-login-action-with-openid-connect).

To deploy through GitHub actions, please refer to the [sample GitHub workflow](https://github.com/Azure/alz-monitor/blob/main/.github/workflows/sample-workflow.yml) and follow the guidance corresponding to your management group hierarchy.

### ALZ aligned

- Modify the following values in [sample-workflow.yml](https://github.com/Azure/alz-monitor/blob/main/.github/workflows/sample-workflow.yml):
  - Change _Location: "norwayeast"_, to your preferred Azure region
  - Change _ManagementGroupPrefix: "alz"_, to the pseudo root management group id parenting the identity, management and connectivity management groups.
  - Change _identityManagementGroup: "alz-platform-identity"_, to the management group for identity in your ALZ implementation.
  - Change _managementManagementGroup: "alz-platform-management"_, to the management group for management in your ALZ implementation.
  - Change _connectivityManagementGroupPrefix: "alz-platform-connectivity"_, to the management group for connectivity in your ALZ implementation.
  - Change _LZGroupPrefix: "alz-landing-zone"_, to the management group for Landing Zones in your ALZ implementation.
- Go to GitHub actions and run the action *Deploy ALZ Monitor policies*

### ALZ unaligned
> For ease of deployment and maintenance we have kept the same variables. If, for example, you combined Identity, Management and Connectivity into one management group you should configure the variables _identityManagementGroup_, _managementManagementGroup_ and _connectivityManagementGroup_ with the same management group.

- Modify the following values in [sample-workflow.yml](https://github.com/Azure/alz-monitor/blob/main/.github/workflows/sample-workflow.yml):
  - Change _Location: "norwayeast"_, to your preferred Azure region
  - Change _ManagementGroupPrefix: "alz"_, to the pseudo root management group parenting the identity, management and connectivity management groups.
  - Change _identityManagementGroup: "alz-platform-identity"_, to the management group for the Identity initiative. The same management group may be repeated.
  - Change _managementManagementGroup: "alz-platform-management"_, to the management group for Management. The same management group may be repeated.
  - Change _connectivityManagementGroupPrefix: "alz-platform-connectivity"_, to the management group for Connectivity. The same management group may be repeated.
  - Change _LZGroupPrefix: "alz-landing-zone"_, to the management group for Landing Zones. The same management group may be repeated.
- Go to GitHub actions and run the action *Deploy ALZ Monitor policies*

### Single management group
> For ease of deployment and maintenance we have kept the same variables. Configure the variables _$ManagementGroupID_, _identityManagementGroup_, _managementManagementGroup_, _connectivityManagementGroup_ and _$LZManagementGroup_ with the pseudo root management group.

- Modify the following values in [sample-workflow.yml](https://github.com/Azure/alz-monitor/blob/main/.github/workflows/sample-workflow.yml):
  - Change _Location: "norwayeast"_, to your preferred Azure region
  - Change _ManagementGroupPrefix: "alz"_, to the pseudo root management group.
  - Change _identityManagementGroup: "alz-platform-identity"_, to the pseudo root management group.
  - Change _managementManagementGroup: "alz-platform-management"_, to the pseudo root management group.
  - Change _connectivityManagementGroupPrefix: "alz-platform-connectivity"_, to the pseudo root management group.
  - Change _LZGroupPrefix: "alz-landing-zone"_, to the pseudo root management group.
- Go to GitHub actions and run the action *Deploy ALZ Monitor policies*
